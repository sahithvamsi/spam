# Spam Classification using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to classify messages as **Spam or Ham** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset of SMS messages and deployed using **Streamlit**.

## 🚀 Live Demo
[Click here to use the Spam Classification app](https://aqu2udi8w7zy8hhoorxdzp.streamlit.app/)
